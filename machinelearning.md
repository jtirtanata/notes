- From psychology, humans have biases, we have tools to analyze information.

# Data
- The old way: surveys, questionnaires
- Census
  - No way to process it
- First data to be processed in a large scale: **human genome project**
  - Did gene sequencing
  - Analyze in a rigorous manner (first time)
  - they started a decade before the rest us
- Internet
  - What gave us tons of data.

## Types of data
1. Continuous
  - Supervised: regression
  - Unsupervised: dim reduction
2. Categorical
  - Supervised:
  - Unsupervised:


# Machine learning
- Branch of AI
- Study systems, learning from data
- Core: representation and generalization
  - extending patterns

## Supervised learning
- Predict based on previous patterns. You have an x and y value. **making predictions** (generalization)
- Examples
  - Credit score
  - Email spam detection, separating spam and non spam emails
  - Stock prices
- **Function approximation**
  - Given some inputs, x, there is some unknown function f(x) that maps our inputs to the outputs
  - We approximate f(x). How? Linear regression.

## Unsupervised learning
- No guiding values, learn patterns and structures. **extracting structure** (representation)
- No label information given at allows
- Methods
  - Clustering: there are different clustering algorithms, and they give different results.

## Notes
- You can have both supervised and unsupervised. E.g. Community detection.
- Unstructured world can give us information that we don't expect.

## Train & Test
- Healthy model: Test errors goes down, training errors goes up but just slightly
