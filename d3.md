# JavaScript
- LISP is very high level.
- JS is a functional language, looks like C.
- Scala is also pretty common.

# D3
- Data Driven Docments
- D3: HTML, SVG, CSS
- To get started:
  - Get a sense of what's available.
  - D3 gallery in github
- Dynamic
- SVG: scalar vector graphic
  - when you scale a raster image, you get pixelated
  - XML object
  - Everything in D3 will be done in the SVG window

### Group Elements
- `g` is a group element.
- you can do any sort of transformations.
- Advantage to make a group: we can group points and text, so that we can
translate in one go 

## HTML
- HTML 5, have the HTML doctype at the top of the page
- use min d3 src for js
